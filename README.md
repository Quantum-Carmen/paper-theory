## Summary

This theory proposes that:

- Anti-protons and other transient particles may be evidence of higher-dimensional interference
- Dimensions behave like layered sheets (metaphorically), capable of folding, denting, and overlapping
- Controlled gravitational and thermal manipulation in closed systems may reveal anomalies or reduce dimensional noise
- The number of dimensions could be estimated through anti-particle flux under known curvature conditions

## Core Sections

- Anti-Proton Behavior and the 4th Dimension
- Wormholes, Black Holes, and Dimensional Tears
- Dimensional Dents (Paper Magnet Experiment)
- Gravitational Gradient Detection Zones (Dowsing Folds)
- Speculative Dimensional Count Equation

## Status

This is a speculative hypothesis intended for public discussion, creative exploration, and future refinement. It is not peer-reviewed (yet).
